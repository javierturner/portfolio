            Hello, my name is Javier Turner, but most people call me JT. I was born and raised in Statesville, NC, then
            moved the Charlotte after graduating from Appalachian State University with a degree in Graphic
            Communications.
<br>
<br>
            I really enjoy both watching and playing soccer (I’m the United States Women’s National Soccer Team’s
            biggest fan) and I play anytime I get a chance. I also enjoy spending time with friends and family, tennis,
            and painting when I have the time.
<br>
<br>
I’m really excited to start a career in full-stack development. I love thinking that goes into the code behind the webpage, the result achieved when everything works correctly, and most importantly, the huge rewarding feeling you get when it all comes together.
